                    Depending on your needs, you can use local or session storage to store data. Both storage methods are similar to cookies but without the same privacy concerns surrounding cookies. Therefore, most modern websites prefer to use web storage methods only or combine them with cookies as a fallback.

                    Global Scope
                    The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
                    <br>
                    Block Scope
                    Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

                    Imagine a nested situation:
                    A block of code enclosed with curly brackets{} containing some block variables.

                    The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.

                    undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.

                    In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this is not the case, avoid overriding it.)

                    A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned.

                    You can use undefined and the strict equality and inequality operators to determine whether a variable has a value. In the following code, the variable x is not initialized, and the if statement evaluates to true.
